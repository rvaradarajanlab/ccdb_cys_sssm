# ccdb_cys_sssm

The file "ccdb_sssm_freq.xlsx" contain 12 sheets including read me sheet. The file contains raw reads of CcdB mutants in different bins for expression and binding
The sheets in this file contain binding and expression raw reads of individual V18D, V18G, V20G, L36A SSSM library as well pooled V18G, V20G and L36A library.

The above mentioned sheets have multiple colums where first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth colums corresponds to residues position of mutant 1, residues position of mutant 2, mutant codon of residue 1, aminoacid mutation at position 1, mutant codon of residue 2 and aminoacid mutation at position 2 respectively. The remaining columns corresponds to different bins used for sorting based on 1D expression and binding.

This file  contain FACS data obtained after sorting cells for expression and binding. The sheet (FACS data) contain the information of mean fluorescent intensity boundry and MFI of different bins. Alexa Fluor 488-A Mean and Alexa Fluor 633-A Mean correspond to mean intensity of a bin for expression and binding respectively.

The last sheet of the file (Barcodes for data extraction) contain information about the barcodes and primer sequence used to amplify ccdB genes from the cells of different bins and to distinguish the reads of different bins from pooled sequencing data.
